# I-need-help-with-my-university-work-
My current objective is that when I want to send a payment to my friend by entering her address and the amount in my DApp, the transaction first sends the amount to the contract, and then after a short predetermined time, it automatically sends the amount to her wallet. However, I can't get that to happen. The amount I entered stays in the contract. Please, I need help. I'm using Remix, Visual Studio, and Live Server to do this. I'm really new to this and need a lot of help.
